          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This week the goal was to program an arduino board to do something. A relative open ended task, but I decided I wanted mine
            to relate to the previous weeks kinetic sculpture. As I left it, the sculpture works will just basic motor power, and no
            precision control. So, the goal of this project is to implement a microcontroller based control system. This would include allowing
            the motors to be turned off an on, and for the motor speeds to be opposite directions, and different speeds.
          </p>

          <h2>Circuity Design</h2>
          <p>
            I ended up having a few different designs for circuits, starting out with the most basic, and then stepping it up from there.
            <br><br>
            First, just a simple circuit that when a switch is closed, the motors turn on. I installed a resistor into 1 of the motor lines,
            as a form of analog speed control. The motor with the lower power will spin slower - thus I can achieve two different speeds 
            with only adding a single resistor.
            <br><br>
            <img src="Circuit 1.jpg" alt="circuit 1" width="35%">
            <br><br>
            After that, I wanted to create something will slightly more control. So I went around to playing with a potentiometer. The first 
            iteration was a version that uses the potentiometer as a threshold device. The data line of the potentiometer is connected to the 
            arduino, and then the data is mapped to 0-100. Then if its above a certain threshold, the board will output signal to a line. This
            line would then act similarly to the previous revision where it will power the two motors, with a resistor between them. This is the
            code I'm using:
            <br><br>
            <pre><code>
              const int potPin = 2;  
              int motor1 = 18;
              int motor2 = 19;
              int potValue;
              int percent;

              void setup() {
                pinMode(motor1, OUTPUT); // specify these pins as outputs
                pinMode(motor2, OUTPUT); // specify these pins as outputs
                pinMode(potPin, INPUT); // specify these pins as inputsa
              }

              void loop() {
                potValue = analogRead(potPin);
                percent = map(potValue,0,1023,0,100);
                
                if (percent > 50){
                  digitalWrite(motor1,HIGH);
                  digitalWrite(motor1,HIGH);
                }
                if else{
                  digitalWrite(motor1,LOW);
                  digitalWrite(motor1,LOW);
                }
              }
            </code></pre>
            <br>

            <br><br>
            <p>
            Then the final revision that I want allows the most user based control by sort of combining these two methods. There will be
            constant power to a switch that feeds into an input pin on the esp32. When the board reads power to the switch it will output
            power to two pins that will be connected to two potentiometers - one for each motor. The potentiometer's data lines will then
            be read into the the board via two separate pins. The potentiometer data will now get mapped to be between -50 and 50, and those
            values for each potentiometer will be outputted via analogWrite to the two motors. Thus the user will have full control over the 
            system. They can control a switch to have the motors be on or off, and then control to potentiometer's that will vary both the 
            speed and direction of the motors for the sculpture. This is the code I used:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
              const int potPinAPower = 2;
              const int potPinBPower = 3;
              const int potPinAData = 2;
              const int potPinBData = 2;
              const int switchPin = 5;
              int motorA = 18;
              int motorB = 19;

              int switchValue;
              int potValueA;
              int potValueB;
              int percentA;
              int percentB;

              void setup() {
                pinMode(motorA, OUTPUT); // specify these pins as outputs
                pinMode(motorB, OUTPUT); // specify these pins as outputs
                pinMode(potPinAPower, OUTPUT); // specify these pins as outputs
                pinMode(potPinBPower, OUTPUT); // specify these pins as outputs
                pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); // specify these pins as inputs
                pinMode(potPinAData, INPUT); // specify these pins as inputs
                pinMode(potPinBData, INPUT); // specify these pins as inputs

              }

              void loop() {
                switchValue = digitalRead(switchPin)

                // if switch closed --> power potentiometers
                if (switchValue > 0){
                  digitalWrite(potPinAPower,HIGH)
                  digitalWrite(potPinBPower,HIGH)
                }
                else {
                  digitalWrite(potPinAPower,LOW)
                  digitalWrite(potPinBPower,LOW)
                }

                // read potentiometers
                potValueA = analogRead(potPinAData);
                potValueB = analogRead(potPinBData);

                // map to values
                percentA = map(potValueA,0,1023,-50,50);
                percentB = map(potValueB,0,1023,-50,50);

                // Analog write values to power motors
                analogWrite(motorA,percentA)
                analogWrite(motorB,percentB)
                
              }

          <h2>Implementation</h2>
          <p>
            Things unfortunately fell apart shortly after creating all my grand designs and plans. I built out the board with the esp32 onto
            a breadboard and was unable to get anything to work for running the motors with the switch potentiometer setup. I worked around
            with the multimeter to try and get a feel for what was going on in the circuity, and everything seemed to be behaving correctly,
            and the motor lines were receiving power when intended.
            <br><br>
            I was worried that the motor wasn't adequate power. The multimeter showed 3.1V on the system, and the motor ran with a raw 5V and 
            a raw 3.3V system. I went over and tested the minimum, and was able to get the motor to run with as little as 1.5V - so this wasn't
            the issue. 
            <br><br> 
            I then switched to the most basic form of doing a resister based switch system from design 1. Even this wasnt working! I was receiving
            current that varied with the resistor used (used between 220 ohm and 10 M ohm) via the multimeter so everything seemsed to be 
            wired correctly. And for all the different voltage outputs that existed with those combinations, I couldn't get the motor to run.
            <br><br>
            I then tried it will LED lights instead and was able to get some good results, so then I shifted over to the second variation where
            power is supplied when the potentiometer is above a threshold. With the LED lights system I was able to get the control to work as intended,
            but again when shifted to the motor system it no longer worked.
            <br><br>
            I spent around 3 hours with Ibrahim and Isa looking through everything. At some point the esp32 seems to no longer be working correctly,
            and we figured maybe it got fried. So, we set out with a new board and set everything back up and were still unable to get the code to work
            correctly. We also tried to print information to the serial monitor, but it only would display giberish, even if it was given sample text 
            to display. This was especially frustrating because then we couldn't get information on what the potentiometers were outputting. We eventually
            concluded that there was some issue with the computer to esp interaction, as well as some issue with using a data pin power source for a motor. 
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in implementing a working system, but I think I managed to gain a lot of clarity regarding how to go forward
            with the esp32 system, and with troubleshooting microcontroller programming. When I make a more permanent version of this sculpture, I will work
            to have a circuit design that has a similar affect as above, but probably will be run on the arduino, just to make my life easier.
