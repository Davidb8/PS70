      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>
        My Final Project is BarBot, everyone's favorite bartending assistant.
        <br><br>
        Gone are the days of trying and failing to craft cocktails and not knowing what to do. And gone are the days of being bogged down by countless
        repetitive motions of measuring out shots. Bar bot will be similar to the now growing craze of the "Bartesian", which works like a Keurig that
        takes in a pod of cocktail mixture as well as your preferred liquors, and crafts the perfect ratio. I envision something with a little more flexability,
        variety, and user involvement.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        The vision is that you can either manually select what you need from the BarBot to be dispensed (1.5 oz of some liquor), and it will be 
        hooked up to all of the necessary bottles located in a discrete lower location. Then it is just a matter of inserting the shaker or whatever
        container you are using and pressing a button and it will dispense what you need. The second mode is the cool part. There will be several NFC
        cards each labeled with a different drink, you can tap the card, and the display with give you instructions on how to craft the cocktail.
        It will tell you what you need to do step by step, where you put in the non liquid ingredients, and the BarBot will pour in everything else.
        Now, anyone and everyone can be a professional bartender!

      <h2>The Plan</h2>
      <p>
        All good plans start with knowing what I will need. For the body of the BarBot, I will use extruded aluminum to build a cage, that is 
        filled in with either a nice finished wood, or acrylic. Those will be the main two materials for my structure. For the mechanical parts, 
        I will need a lot of tubing, stepper motors, bottle fittings, and o ring type seals to keep everything clean and airtight. Finally for 
        electronics I will need to have an Arduino (Uno or eps32), NFC reader and cards, digital output display, and assorted wires.
        <br><br>
        I hope to develop all of the electronics and mechanics through the next weeks. I want to be able to generate a digital output based on a 
        NFC card being read, as well as design an efficient system for pumping up liquid approximately 3 feet without requiring a ton of different
        motors or moving parts. In terms of developing parts, I currently don't see a need for 3D printed parts, as most everything can be fabricated 
        with alternative methods, but there will likely be some fittings for connecting different pieces together where I may use 3D printing to
        save some labor. If I can achieve both of those technical feats in the weeks of the class, then I am going to be in a really good spot.
        I'll then be able to focus on putting pieces together and creating an external shell in the final weeks of the semester, and end up with
        the worlds first BarBot!
