          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This week the goal was to work with Output Devices. This is another important week thus far in the context of preparing
            for the final project. For my final project, I will rely on some pretty solid communication between input devices and output devices,
            which is not the most enjoyable thing in the world to create.
            <br><br>
            There are two major "output" devices for my final project, 1 is the digital display and the other are the pumps. The pumps I hope to
            address in the week we spend on stepper motors, so this week was centralized on working on understanding how to use a digital display
            system.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>TFT Display</h2>
          <p>
            So there are two major kinds of displays, TFT and OLED. I went for a TFT, which stands for a Thin Film Transistor Display. The big
            advantages of it are its longer life span and larger screen sizes. I am working with a 2.8 inch display which should be just the
            perfect size for the display on my BarBot. 
            <br><br>
            There are two main things the display is meant to handle. 1 is the menu function that will correspond with the User inputted actions
            with buttons to scroll through the features of the BarBot. The other function will be to display steps and instructions for crafting
            a cocktail. The approach I have settled on is to create bitmap images of each potential display, and then whenever the screen needs to
            display something alternative, the new corresponding bitmap will be loaded to the display. 
            <br><br>
            <img src="sample bitmap.jpg" alt="sample bitmap" width="35%">
            <br><br>
            Wiring up the board was not the most difficult thing in the world, it was a lot of different connections, and the online resources were 
            typically for alternative TFT boards, but I managed to get it figured out. The harder step was getting the SD card that is built into
            the TFT board to function correctly. It involved essentially having a separate Master-Slave connection system on the TFT for the SD
            reading. But after being able to wire everything, I was able to load up a bitmap file I created and have it display to the screen.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <img src="Example Graphic.gif" alt="Example Image Display" width="35%">
            <br><br>
          </p>
          <h2>Combining Inputs and Outputs</h2>
          <p>
            As you can see, this is a slightly slow process to update the screen, but everything looks great! The next step is to create a few more 
            bitmaps. I think the goal for this week is to have the NFC reader that I programmed last week to determine the graphic displayed on 
            the TFT display. So, I went about creating the integration for an arduino script that has both the input and output devices working together,
            And I unfortunately ended up with this error.
            <br><br>
            <img src="error.jpg" alt="Board Schematic" width="80%">
            <br><br>
            The Arduino Uno apparently has a very limited onboard storage for scripts. The TFT libraries for uploading bitmaps to the screen and accessing 
            the SD card are extremely large, and when combined with the libraries for the NFC sensor, it actually exceeds the storage allocation, and
            thus I couldn't upload my script! So this was a bit of a bummer, the solution to this long term is to shift over to the ESP32 which has 
            significantly more memory storage, but it will involve a decent amount of trouble shooting time for working with a different microcontroller,
            so I am planning to take that time in the coming weeks, and for now use an alternative input device for testing.
            <br><br>
            So I shifted over to a simple button input, and whenever the button is pressed it will cycle through the graphics. This was good practice
            for the programming challenges I will have with the multitasking and ensuring I dont overcrowd by output devices with information. I am using
            a readButton() function that utilizes Millis for the button input, and whenever the button is pressed it will cycle a value between 1, 2, and 3. 
            Then the updateScreen() function
            will see if that value corresponds to the graphic already on the display, if it is, then the screen does not update (to prevent backlogging), 
            and the value does not correspond to what is being displayed, it will update the display and not allow for the updating of the values with
            the button.
            <br><br>
            <img src="Final Wiring.jpg" alt="Board Schematic" width="35%">
            <video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="Final Product.mp4" type="video/mp4" width = "35%">
            </video> 
            <br><br>
            So everything seems to be working well! I am glad with the progress that I was able to make on this, and while I wasn't able to integrate
            the TFT display with the NFC inputs, the porting should be relatively simple to go from a button input to an NFC input once I transition
            to the ESP32. 
            <br><br>
            I also hooked up an oscilloscope to the clock mechanism of my TFT display and this is what the oscilloscope displayed:
            <br><br>
            <img src="ossilascope.gif" alt="Board Schematic" width="35%">
            <br><br>
            I Hooked up between ground and the DC into the scope, and it sowed a naturally fluctuating signal. Once I pressed the button
            to update the screen though, the signal being heavily more volatile. I believe this is due to the use of varying voltage values
            to transmit information quickly on what should be displayed on the TFT screen. Super cool to see this in action.

            <br><br>
            As always, here is the code that I used for the final script.
