          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This week the goal was to work on our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our final project. This is theoretically the most challenging 
            component to design or build or make function into my system for my final project.
            <br><br>
            For me, the most challenging part of my BarBot will likely be the precision pumping to ensure pouring of an exact amount of fluid. This is a great 
            time to work on this part of my project because we just started to work with Stepper Motors. Use a pretty fancy setup of electromagenates to give 
            extreme precision to the steps (to the order of like a millionth of a degree if you are microstepping). I don't think I need that level of precision,
            but I do want to be able to get pretty close to 1.5 oz pours consistenently. 
            <br><br>
            With that, the goal is to learn how to use a stepper motor, make a pump carriage that fits onto the motor, and pump some water!

          <h2>Pump Building</h2>
          <p>
            I spoke with Nathan who recommended the 28BYJ stepper motor, which is pretty small with decent power, but is still very cheep (which is 
            good because I will need several). So, as to not reinvent the wheel, I headed to the internet to find out if anyone had made a peristaltic
            pump before, to see what of their designs I could harvest. I found <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/63352-mini-peristaltic-pump-for-28byj-48-stepper-motor/files">this</a>
            which is a pump that someone else made for this motor - how convenient!! So I downloaded their STL files for thw 4mm tubing version (as I am
            primarly focused on speed), and went to printing. Everything printed perfectly, and once the bearings I ordered to pinch the tubing came in,
            I set out to assembly 
            <br><br>
            <img src="prusa slicer.png" alt="STL of Pump" width="35%">
            <img src="4mm pump.jpg" alt="4mm Pump" width="35%">
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, I soon found out that we only have 3mm and 5mm tubing in stock in the shop. I thought we had 4mm but I was just squeezing the
            5mm to cope. So I had to go back and reprint to the 3mm pump version. Now things were fitting together much more nicely.
            <br><br>
          </p>

          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>
            To test the system, I setup two cups and wrote up a super short bit of code just to run the motor for a half a rotation. In the future, I will
            do testing to determine how many "steps" the motor needs to take to correspond to 1.5oz of fluid being pumped. The code is linked 
            <a download href='Week10\motor running\motor running.ino'>here.</a>
            <br><br>
            <img src="###.jpg" alt="Final Pump Working" width="35%">
            <br><br>
            And when running the system we see that the water is going through the pump!! The process is a little slow at the moment, and the motor does
            get extremely hot after running for a few minutes. So those will both be things that need to be figured out. But once I figure that out, as well as
            the step count needed, I will basically just have to make more pumps, and I will have finished this aspect of my project.
